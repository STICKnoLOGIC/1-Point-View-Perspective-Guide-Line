1 point view perspective guide line is a fork of  [**1-Point Perspective Helper**](https://gunturtle.itch.io/perspective-helper) by **[GunTurtle](https://gunturtle.itch.io/).**

**1 point view perspective guide line** is a tool for pixel art and animation software Aseprite.

**This tool allows for**

*   Creating a perspective grid centered on any point of the screen
*   Setting the number of gridlines on all axes
*   Animating the center of perspective, as well as the grid on the Z axis
*   Basic smoothing features in animation

**why reinventing a wheel??**

"I didn't reinvent the wheel/ the script" instead I grab it, experiment with it and do some improvements, one improvement that I did was the preview while tinkering the axes (x,y,z) and I also add a capability to change the color of guide line.

please comment here and discuss possible solution!

or you can file an issue in [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/STICKnoLOGIC/1-Point-View-Perspective-Guide-Line/issues)

  

**Tried and Tested:**

Aseprite version 1.3.x

OS: Windows 11 and 10

cpu: intel 15 4th gen

igpu: intel hd graphics 4000

**NOTE:**

*   this extension is cpu hungry, might hang your pc while generating guide lines especially when the canvas is enormous and animation is enabled.
*   the extension might ask you to allow the script to tweak the system, you can safely deny it and block the extension if you fail unsafe doing so.

  

**How to use the extension**  

In order to analyze a sprite you need to:

1.  Install the extension and restart Aseprite (you can install it from Edit > Preferences > Extensions > Add Extension)
2.  Open any sprite/image
3.  Go to the Layer menu > New.. and click the 1 point View Perspective Guide Line option near the bottom or simply press "Space" + "1"
